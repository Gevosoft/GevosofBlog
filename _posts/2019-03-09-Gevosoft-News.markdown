We have redesigned almost everything related to the Journal Companion app.
We have updated:
* The app

We also pushed out version 16.1 which includes an awesome sync feature! Yes, we improved on the old backup feature and made a Multi-Device sync feature that backups & syncs all of your data (logs, pages, notes, tasks) securely and in the background.
